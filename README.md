> Sorry for the recent inactivity here. To be clear,  I do in fact still plan to update this mod, and may have actually found a partner helping we with this, but currently my other mod, [Modget](https://github.com/ReviversMC/modget-minecraft), is just too time-consuming. If you are somewhat experienced with Minecraft modding, we would be very grateful if you could help us out a little!

This mod is a port of the original Oceancraft mod made by thomassu ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/thomassu04) | [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIS8hi4sDmKVFkcn9PXQbLA)):

It extends Minecraft's oceans with a much greater variety of animals, plants, building blocks and more. Update Aquatic 2.0!


NOTE: This mod is currently in Alpha and is missing many features. They will be added over the next few months!
